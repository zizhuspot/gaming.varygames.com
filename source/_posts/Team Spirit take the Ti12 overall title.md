## Team Spirit Takes Ti12 Title, Chinese Army Takes Third Place

In the 2023 DOTA2 International Invitational Tournament that ended this morning, Team Spirit finally won the Ti12 Championship with a 3:0 victory over Team GG, which is also Team Spirit's second podium after two years, and it also tied the record of two championships held by Team OG.

In addition, two teams from China, LGD and AR, took the third place and third place respectively. The two domestic teams were generally not favored by outsiders before the tournament, and with only two seats this time to take the third and fourth place, for domestic DOTA2 fans, it is already an over-achievement.

After the tournament, the game's lead developer IceFrog also posted a message on Weibo congratulating Team Spirit on their win:

As a well-known "yearly blogger", IceFrog basically only updates his microblog at the end of Ti every year, so he was also teased by netizens for "accomplishing the annual target".

The game's worldview takes place in a twisted world ruled by SEGA, who have given self-will to various classic games and use their powers to change the world into what they want it to be. 

As for the reason for the discontinuation, the discontinuation announcement states that "the development team has been unable to produce enough game content to maintain operations despite various tie-ins and out-of-game programs, and has been forced to make the decision to discontinue the game."

However, although the game will be discontinued early next year, in order to allow players to continue to enjoy the game in its final hours, the official government will still maintain the original update program and launch new activities until the game is officially discontinued.
