## Diablo 4 not joining XGP this year for now

According to IGN reports, Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard will be completed this week, and once this massive acquisition is completed, the platforms where Activision's various games belong have become a hot topic among gamers.

Previously regarding Activision's Call of Duty series, Microsoft has reached an agreement with rival Sony that "Call of Duty-related games will continue to be updated and run on PlayStation after the acquisition is complete."

And just this week, Activision Blizzard mentioned on its official tweet (Official X) that there are no plans to include Diablo 4 and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 in Game Pass this year for now.

## Roblox is launching V-Land, a virtual world program designed to eliminate "menstrual shame.

Swedish hygiene products maker Essity and feminine care brand Saba are teaming up with multiplayer sandbox platform Roblox to launch a virtual world project called "V-Land," which aims to teach underage children about the human body and eliminate the stigma associated with menstruation.

Essity's 2022 Global Health and Wellness Survey found that only 55 percent of people think they understand menstruation, while another survey of women found that 44 percent of women feel uncomfortable talking about menstruation with male relatives such as fathers and brothers.

Essity wants to raise awareness about menstrual health through science in the form of a game, thereby removing the shame in the matter.

"We wanted to start an innovative program that educates while gaming. Hence the decision to launch V-Land in Roblox, a world where players can find tampons, blood clots or uteruses. Each element has been carefully selected to raise awareness about menstruation, and we want players to experience an emotionally charged and exciting adventure without ridicule or bullying."


## EA Announces EA Sports FC 24 Has Reached 11.3 Million Users Worldwide in First Week of Release

EA's classic soccer game series, FIFA, has officially released the game this year under the name "EA Sports FC 24" as it ended its partnership with FIFA last year.

Despite mixed feelings from veteran gamers about the "game of the year," early reports indicate that physical sales of the game are down compared to its predecessor, and the Steam review rate is only 55%:

But in reality, the game's player base has only grown, with "11.3 million players worldwide" since FC24's launch, according to Game Industry.

The statistics are the total number of players registered for the game on various platforms, including PS, Xbox, Switch, and PC platforms, which is naturally much higher than offline sales of the physical game, but it also shows that even though the game's reputation has declined, it is still the game of choice for soccer fans and veteran players.

Cam Weber, president of EA Sports, said, "In addition to welcoming back millions of veteran players, the number of new players for FC24 is up nearly 20 percent year-over-year. This reflects the passion that fans everywhere have for the game. We are building the world's largest soccer community with EA SPORTS FC and are just getting started."
