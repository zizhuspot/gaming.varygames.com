## Born from grassroots CN APEX dreamers, with what to go to the present?

The crowd at the ALGS Championships, APEX's highest-level event, chanted these words at the Copper Box Arena in Birmingham, England, on September 9 of this year. A few hours later, it reappeared as a hot search term at the top of the Hot 100.

The Chinese APEX teams, who were originally not favored, eventually made it to the finals of this ALGS. DF, with their dominating performance on the first day of the main event, advanced to the finals as a dark horse, while the other team, MDY.W, played steadily and also managed to break into the finals to meet DF.

The only two domestic teams that made history at every step of the way gave domestic players, who only thought that "making it to the finals would be a success", a real hope for CN APEX to win the championship. It is also because of their excellent play in this tournament that they have successfully made a name for the region, EA announced in early October the year four program, gave CN a direct invitation to the next year's ALGS.

## Welcome to the ALGS, CN Region!

Luckily, the road to the championship that no one expected at CN APEX was followed and documented by our agency.

From the player's home, filled with apprehension and free-flowing thoughts before the tournament, to Birmingham, where they trumpeted with passion and fury after the opening rounds, the two grassroots teams talked about the tournament and the teams, as well as quite a few of their own stories. The team that took the plunge and joined a team with no pay, no sponsorship and no club, or the team that put aside their more lucrative full-time anchoring jobs for a while, or the team that danced from stage to stage.

But the only constant is that all these CN APEX players who come from different places and head side by side in the same direction look like the protagonist of a dream MDY.W's old hangman once had:

Before the game, he had dreamed that in the key game, they won the championship with the last hand of chicken. He just kept crying next to the sea of people and didn't say anything. Then he woke up after realizing it was a dream, but couldn't stop crying - because whether it was a dream or reality, this was what they had been after all along.

As the new season of APEX is about to launch, this video will bring the story of this group of dream chasers. About their on-stage and behind-the-scenes, about their growth, and about the dreams they still continue to have.
