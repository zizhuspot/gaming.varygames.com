## Neverwinter gets Sony's "Gamer's Choice Award"

On August 17th, Sony PlayStation's official Twitter account announced that the game that won the Gamer's Choice Award in July was Neverwinter.

It should be noted that the selection of this award is based on an official voting campaign at the end of each month, in which all players can vote for the new games released that month according to their personal preferences, and only the work with the highest number of votes will be officially awarded the "Players' Choice Award".

Some familiar masterpieces or topical works have received this award, such as this year's "Hogwarts Legacy", last year's "Eldon's Law Ring", "Stray" and so on, which are games with high popularity and popularity among players.

This time, "Neverwinter" is more special, as you know, it is not a new release, in the past two years it has been launched on PC and Xbox platforms respectively, and even players who have not been exposed to "Neverwinter", I believe that they have already heard of this game from all major social media platforms.

In July this year, in the "eternal disaster" officially from the buyout system to the free operation of the day, the game also finally in the PlayStation platform, and the same period of the topic of new works and "relics of the 2" and VR2 game "Synapse", as a game has been on the line for more than two years, the "eternal disaster" can still stand out from them, it is really not easy.

We've covered the game and its recent updates many times before, and it's been recognized for its sincerity, both in terms of how often it's been updated with new content and the benefits it's given back to veteran players since going free-to-play.


## For new players who have not yet been exposed to the game

For new players who have not yet been exposed to the game, a game's exposure on the platform and the awards it has achieved are undoubtedly an important factor in influencing them to enter the pit, so in this regard, how is the current performance of "Forever Unchained"?

First take the highest visibility Steam platform, before July, the game has reached 20 million sales in the world, and basically maintains a stable rate of growth of 10 million per year, has set a new record of domestic buyout sales in recent years. The steady growth of players also shows that even though the game has been online for two years, officials are still maintaining player retention with efficient and quality-assured version updates.

On July 6, the day the game was announced to be moving to free-to-play, Neverwinter sold another one million copies on Steam, even surging to second place on the daily sales chart:

Part of the reason that these newcomers were willing to buy the game at its original price on the eve of its free-to-play release was, of course, the generous compensation, but whether it's "compensation" or "free", it's certainly an attractive incentive for those who are still uncertain or skeptical about the game's quality. Or to the game quality is still skeptical of the players a real opportunity to enter the pit, and the official is obviously confident to rely on high-quality game content to retain this part of the newcomers.

Over the past year, the game has been released on different platforms and consoles, and has been linked to a number of IPs. In June last year, the game was selected for Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass, and it also landed on the host platform Xbox. It should be noted that the games that join the XGP are selected by Microsoft, and basically they are all works with guaranteed quality and reputation.

As the first domestic game to join the XGP, this is also a quality recognition of "Forever Robbery" itself, and in the first month of the launch of Xbox, the game's new players have already exceeded 1 million, and resident in the platform's best-seller list.

## The game's arrival on PlayStation

The game's arrival on PlayStation, the other major console, in July this year was a "free" addition, but it still stood out from other popular games that month, winning the "Player's Choice" award, which is voted on entirely by gamers, demonstrating its popularity. "The fact that it won the Player's Choice Award, which was voted on entirely by players, is a testament to its influence among gamers, as the last Chinese game to win the award was ProtoGod.

Together with the other big platform Epic, the "Forever Robbery" has also been on the best-seller list for many years, and has received the "most popular game" award selected by the platform. Taken together, this game has achieved good sales results and awards in all platforms and shopping centers, and has almost been recognized by most players on each platform. This is not easy for a product that has been in operation for two years and switched from buyout to free-to-play.

Therefore, at this point in time, the official government has also taken the opportunity of the "Grand Slam on Four Platforms" to launch more generous player feedback activities.

## The game has won different awards on all four platforms, which is really a "Grand Slam"!

In this weekend, players can get 100 hero coins by going online, that is, they can directly get a hero of their choice, and there are experience bonus, secret treasure bonus, PVE rewards and other benefits, which can be said to be the excellent rewards given by the official government once again after the last turn of free feedback, and the conditions for obtaining them are basically zero threshold.

## Officials defined this event as "Grand Slam Weekend".

The results achieved by "Eternal Robbery" on the platform also show that the game is still hot, and is not "relying on turning free to pull popularity" as some players think, while the game can achieve such results, but also with the production team to listen to players' voices, improve the game experience and satisfy different demands.

For example, to address the problem of the game being too hardcore, they added a PVE mode to meet the needs of light players on the one hand, and on the other hand, they designed a functional training mode for those players who are willing to improve but are unable to do so:


## The training mode provides a lot of useful specialized exercises

For example, in order to deal with the problem of "the proliferation of cheat software and the low cost of hanging", the production team also cooperated with the public security organs and cracked down on a number of gangs making hangers, and the banning announcements of offending players have always been frequently released on the official blog.

Therefore, players have reason to believe that "Forever Robbery Infernal", which has gained such achievements and honors, will continue to update this game with even better quality and an attitude of valuing players in the third year of its operation cycle, just as it has been officially promised. It is also worthwhile to look at the prospects and quality of this domestic game in the future with more confidence.
